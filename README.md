# AutoSave Macro Application

## Introduction

This terminal application is designed to automate the process of saving your work in any application by simulating the `CTRL + S` (or `Command + S` on macOS) keyboard shortcut. It's particularly useful in scenarios where an application does not support auto-save functionality. The script is set to trigger the save command every 30 seconds, ensuring that your progress is regularly saved without manual intervention.

## Features

- **Automatic Saving:** Simulates the save command (`CTRL + S` or `Command + S`) every 30 seconds.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple to start and runs in the background, allowing you to focus on your work without interruptions.
- **Customizable Interval:** While the default save interval is set to 30 seconds, it can be easily adjusted to fit your needs.
